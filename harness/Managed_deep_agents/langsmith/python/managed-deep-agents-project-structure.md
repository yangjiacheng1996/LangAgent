# Managed Deep Agents project structure

> Understand the project layout for Managed Deep Agents.

A Managed Deep Agents project is a normal Python package with one required root agent entry. Other paths are either ordinary modules you import, or files and directories that MDA discovers to enable managed capabilities.

<Note>
  Managed Deep Agents is in **public [beta](/langsmith/release-stages)** and available on [LangSmith Cloud](/langsmith/cloud) in the US region only.

The only required file is `agent.py` at the project root containing the [agent definition](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-agent-definition) as a named `agent`. It must export a named `agent` created with `define_deep_agent`. Use only one agent entry in a project.

## How MDA treats project files

* **Managed context**: [`instructions.md`](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-instructions) defines the system prompt. Each directory under [`skills/`](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-skills) contains task-specific instructions, such as a `SKILL.md` and any supporting files. MDA syncs both `instructions.md` and `skills/` to Context Hub.

* **Application code**: Files under [`tools/`](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-tools) and [`middleware/`](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-middleware) are ordinary project modules. Import them from the agent entry. Other local modules work the same way.

* **Managed configuration**: Certain paths enable capabilities when present. For `channels/`, `connectors/`, and `schedules/`, only direct children are managed declarations; nested modules are not.

  | Path                   | Enables                                                                         |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `identity.py`          | [Caller authentication](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-identity)         |
  | `memory.py`            | [Durable memory](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-memory)                  |
  | `channels/<name>.py`   | [Messaging channels](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-channels)            |
  | `connectors/<name>.py` | [MCP connectors](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-mcp-connectors)          |
  | `schedules/<name>.py`  | [Cron schedules](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-schedules)               |
  | `sandbox/__init__.py`  | [Sandbox filesystem and shell](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-sandboxes) |

  MCP connector modules export a module-level `connector`.

* **Dependencies and secrets**: Declare dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. MDA loads `.env` locally and forwards non-reserved values as deployment secrets. Reserved platform variables and `.env` files are not included in the build archive. For more information, see [Deploy a Managed Deep Agent](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-deploy).

* **Evals**: Managed Deep Agents [evals](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-evals) are Harbor evals. Run `mda evals init -i` and develop tasks with a coding agent and the `eval-engineering` skill. Generated runtime files stay under `.mda/evals/` and are not included in the deployed agent build.
