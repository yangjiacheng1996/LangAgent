# Build a personal assistant with subagents

The **supervisor pattern** is a [multi-agent](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) architecture where a central supervisor agent coordinates specialized worker agents. This approach excels when tasks require different types of expertise. Rather than building one agent that manages tool selection across domains, you create focused specialists coordinated by a supervisor who understands the overall workflow.

In this tutorial, you'll build a personal assistant system that coordinates two specialists with fundamentally different responsibilities:

- A **calendar agent** that handles scheduling, availability checking, and event management.
- An **email agent** that manages communication, drafts messages, and sends notifications.

We will also incorporate [human-in-the-loop review](/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop) to allow users to approve, edit, and reject actions (such as outbound emails).

### Why use a supervisor?

Multi-agent architectures allow you to partition [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) across workers, each with their own individual prompts or instructions. Consider an agent with direct access to all calendar and email APIs: it must choose from many similar tools, understand exact formats for each API, and handle multiple domains simultaneously. If performance degrades, it may be helpful to separate related tools and associated prompts into logical groups.

## Setup

This tutorial requires the `langchain` package:

```bash
pip install langchain
```

For more details, see our [Installation guide](/oss/python/langchain/install).

## 1. Define tools

```python
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def create_calendar_event(
    title: str,
    start_time: str,       # ISO format: "2024-01-15T14:00:00"
    end_time: str,         # ISO format: "2024-01-15T15:00:00"
    attendees: list[str],  # email addresses
    location: str = ""
) -> str:
    """Create a calendar event. Requires exact ISO datetime format."""
    return f"Event created: {title} from {start_time} to {end_time} with {len(attendees)} attendees"


@tool
def send_email(
    to: list[str],  # email addresses
    subject: str,
    body: str,
    cc: list[str] = []
) -> str:
    """Send an email via email API. Requires properly formatted addresses."""
    return f"Email sent to {', '.join(to)} - Subject: {subject}"


@tool
def get_available_time_slots(
    attendees: list[str],
    date: str,  # ISO format: "2024-01-15"
    duration_minutes: int
) -> list[str]:
    """Check calendar availability for given attendees on a specific date."""
    return ["09:00", "14:00", "16:00"]
```

## 2. Create specialized sub-agents

### Create a calendar agent

```python
from datetime import date
from langchain.agents import create_agent

CALENDAR_AGENT_PROMPT = (
    f"Today's date is {date.today().isoformat()}. "
    "You are a calendar scheduling assistant. "
    "Parse natural language scheduling requests (e.g., 'next Tuesday at 2pm') "
    "into proper ISO datetime formats. "
    "Use get_available_time_slots to check availability when needed. "
    "Use create_calendar_event to schedule events. "
    "Always confirm what was scheduled in your final response."
)

calendar_agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[create_calendar_event, get_available_time_slots],
    system_prompt=CALENDAR_AGENT_PROMPT,
)
```

### Create an email agent

```python
EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT = (
    "You are an email assistant. "
    "Compose professional emails based on natural language requests. "
    "Extract recipient information and craft appropriate subject lines and body text. "
    "Use send_email to send the message. "
    "Always confirm what was sent in your final response."
)

email_agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[send_email],
    system_prompt=EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT,
)
```

## 3. Wrap sub-agents as tools

```python
@tool
def schedule_event(request: str) -> str:
    """Schedule calendar events using natural language.

    Use this when the user wants to create, modify, or check calendar appointments.
    Handles date/time parsing, availability checking, and event creation.
    """
    result = calendar_agent.invoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": request}]
    })
    return result["messages"][-1].text


@tool
def manage_email(request: str) -> str:
    """Send emails using natural language.

    Use this when the user wants to send notifications, reminders, or any email
    communication. Handles recipient extraction, subject generation, and email
    composition.
    """
    result = email_agent.invoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": request}]
    })
    return result["messages"][-1].text
```

The tool descriptions help the supervisor decide when to use each tool, so make them clear and specific. We return only the sub-agent's final response, as the supervisor doesn't need to see intermediate reasoning or tool calls.

## 4. Create the supervisor agent

```python
SUPERVISOR_PROMPT = (
    "You are a helpful personal assistant. "
    "You can schedule calendar events and send emails. "
    "Break down user requests into appropriate tool calls and coordinate the results. "
    "When a request involves multiple actions, use multiple tools in sequence or in parallel as appropriate."
)

supervisor_agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[schedule_event, manage_email],
    system_prompt=SUPERVISOR_PROMPT,
)
```

## 5. Use the supervisor

Test your complete system with complex requests:

```python
query = (
    "Schedule a meeting with the design team next Tuesday at 2pm for 1 hour, "
    "and send them an email reminder about reviewing the new mockups."
)

stream = supervisor_agent.stream_events(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": query}]},
    version="v3",
)
for kind, item in stream.interleave("messages", "tool_calls"):
    if kind == "messages":
        for token in item.text:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
    elif kind == "tool_calls":
        print(f"\nTool call: {item.tool_name}({item.input})")
        print(f"Tool result: {item.output}")
```

The supervisor recognizes this requires both calendar and email actions, calls `schedule_event` for the meeting, then calls `manage_email` for the reminder. Each sub-agent completes its task, and the supervisor synthesizes both results into a coherent response.

## 7. Add human-in-the-loop review

Add [human-in-the-loop review](/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop) of sensitive actions using built-in middleware:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import HumanInTheLoopMiddleware
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver


calendar_agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[create_calendar_event, get_available_time_slots],
    system_prompt=CALENDAR_AGENT_PROMPT,
    middleware=[
        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(
            interrupt_on={"create_calendar_event": True},
            description_prefix="Calendar event pending approval",
        ),
    ],
)

email_agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[send_email],
    system_prompt=EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT,
    middleware=[
        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(
            interrupt_on={"send_email": True},
            description_prefix="Outbound email pending approval",
        ),
    ],
)

supervisor_agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[schedule_event, manage_email],
    system_prompt=SUPERVISOR_PROMPT,
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)
```

When you run the supervisor, execution pauses when sub-agents call sensitive tools. Resume with `Command(resume=...)` to provide approve/edit/reject decisions:

```python
from langgraph.types import Command

# Inspect the interrupts, then resume with decisions
resume = {}
for interrupt_ in interrupts:
    if interrupt_.id == "email_interrupt":
        edited_action = interrupt_.value["action_requests"][0].copy()
        edited_action["args"]["subject"] = "Mockups reminder"
        resume[interrupt_.id] = {
            "decisions": [{"type": "edit", "edited_action": edited_action}]
        }
    else:
        resume[interrupt_.id] = {"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}

stream = supervisor_agent.stream_events(
    Command(resume=resume),
    config,
    version="v3",
)
```

## 8. Advanced: Control information flow

By default, sub-agents receive only the request string from the supervisor. You might want to pass additional context, such as conversation history or user preferences:

```python
from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime

@tool
def schedule_event(
    request: str,
    runtime: ToolRuntime
) -> str:
    """Schedule calendar events using natural language."""
    original_user_message = next(
        message for message in runtime.state["messages"]
        if message.type == "human"
    )
    prompt = (
        "You are assisting with the following user inquiry:\n\n"
        f"{original_user_message.text}\n\n"
        "You are tasked with the following sub-request:\n\n"
        f"{request}"
    )
    result = calendar_agent.invoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    })
    return result["messages"][-1].text
```
